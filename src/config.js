We'd recommend bringing anything from a bench scraper to a butter knife to slice the pizza. Slicing the whole pizza when it's hot inhibits the crust from properly setting, and can cause the crust to get soggy both during transit and as the pie is eaten. We want your pizza to be the best possible and bringing a tool with which to slice the pie will make a big difference. You will need to remove this request to continue with your order.";
